## Challenge

The legacy CMS slowed down publishing and made multilingual management painful. Marketers spent two hours a day on manual translations.

## Solution

- Shipped TR/EN/DE pages with Next.js App Router and static rendering.
- Synced the MDX content system with Airtable for structured workflows.
- Connected reservation forms to the CRM through Make automations.
